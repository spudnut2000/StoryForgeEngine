# Story Forge Engine
This is the official repository for the Story Forge Engine developed by Hex Studios. https://hexstudios.co/

### What is Story Forge?
The Story Forge Engine is an open source game engine written in C++ and OpenGL, using the freeGlut library. It is designed to help developers create video games that involve a lot of story elements, such as: Quests, etc.

### How do I use it?
As of now there is only a Linux application, but as it is open source you can download the source files and install the necessary libraries to build the application: `libglu1-mesa-dev`, `freeglut3-dev`, and `mesa-common-dev`. 

* *These are the package names on the APT repository, so names may be different*

* **We will be providing documentation once the engine is at a point of usability**
